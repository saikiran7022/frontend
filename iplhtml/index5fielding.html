of the match.No doubt Sir.Jadeja is the best fielder In the world ,but still “Suresh Raina” has taken most catches
in the IPl history and standing 1 st among the list.

One of the other kind of run out is known as MANKAD.
During bowling,if a bowler turns his arm round and rather than releasing the ball,hits out the bails of the non-
striking batsman and runs him out, then this type of dismissal is called as a Mankad.
