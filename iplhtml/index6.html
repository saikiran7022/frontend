                 <p><tt>In cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in Test matches in the mid 1980s.The man of
the match title is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most critical in winning the
game.
In one match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from New Zeland was awarded the Men of the Match
award. It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it. 
In IPL,Chris gayle holds the record for the highest number of awards won, with 21 in IPL.

                 <p><tt>The Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method (DLS) is a mathematical formulation designed to calculate the target
score for the team batting second in a ”limited overs cricket” match interrupted by weather or other
circumstances. The method was devised by two English  statisticians ,  Frank Duckworth  and  Tony Lewis  and was
formerly known as the Duckworth–Lewis method (D/L). 
The DLS method is an attempt to set a statistically fair target for the second team&#39;s innings, which is the
same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two
resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted
proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.
Here are the count of teams won maximum times with DL method applied.</tt></p>
